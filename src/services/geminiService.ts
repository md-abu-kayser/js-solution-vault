      As an expert JavaScript developer and teacher, explain the following JavaScript function.

      \`\`\`javascript

      \`\`\`

      Your explanation should be:
      1.  **Clear and concise:** Easy for an intermediate JS developer to understand.
      2.  **Step-by-step:** Break down the logic.
      3.  **Use Markdown:** Use **bold** for emphasis and \`code\` for inline code snippets or variable names. Do not use headers. Start directly with the explanation.
      4.  **Focus on the "how" and "why":** Explain the purpose of key lines or blocks of code.
